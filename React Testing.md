## Testing

### Performance

1.  **Jest and React Testing Library:**

    - **Performance:**
      - Use React Profiler Component together with jest to detect changes in rendering counts.
      - Leverage Jest's snapshot testing for components to ensure they don't unintentionally change in size or complexity.
      - Detect unexpected changes in component size or rendering behavior.
      - Maintain performance baselines for individual components.

2.  **Lighthouse CI:**

        - Integrate [Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci) into your continuous integration pipeline to automatically test your application's performance and get performance reports during your CI/CD process.

3.  **Continuous Monitoring:**

    - Implement continuous monitoring tools like New Relic, Datadog, or other Application Performance Monitoring (APM) solutions.
    - Set up alerts based on performance thresholds to receive notifications when performance degrades beyond specified limits.
